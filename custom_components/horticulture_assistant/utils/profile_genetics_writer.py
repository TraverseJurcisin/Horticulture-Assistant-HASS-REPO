    """
    Generate or update genetics and cultivar lineage profile files for a given plant.

    This function scaffolds two JSON files (`genetics.json` and `cultivar_lineage.json`) in the `plants/<plant_id>/` directory.
    It populates these files with predefined keys related to the plant's genetic profile and cultivar lineage,
    with all values defaulting to null (JSON null, represented as None in Python).

    If a file already exists and `overwrite` is False, the file is left unchanged.
    If `overwrite` is True or the file is missing, a new file is created (or an existing file is overwritten) with the default structure.

    All actions (creation, skipping, overwriting) are logged for clarity.

    :param plant_id: Identifier for the plant (used as directory name under the base path).
    :param base_path: Optional base directory path for plant profiles (defaults to "plants/" in the current working directory).
    :param overwrite: If True, overwrite existing files; if False, skip writing if files already exist.
    :return: The plant_id if profiles were successfully generated (or already present without changes),
             or an empty string on error (e.g., if directory creation fails).
