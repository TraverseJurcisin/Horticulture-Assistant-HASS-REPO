    This scaffolds a directory under the base_path (defaults to "plants") named after the plant_id,
    and creates two JSON files within it: "drying_log.json" and "curing_log.json".
    Each file is initialized as an empty list to which drying or curing events can be appended.
    Each drying log entry includes timestamp, method (e.g., rack, oven, freeze-dry), start_moisture_pct,
    target_moisture_pct, temp_range_C, RH_range_pct, airflow_rate_cfm, duration_hrs, observed_outcome, and notes.
    Each curing log entry includes timestamp, method (e.g., burp, vacuum, sealed humidistat), container_type,
    duration_days, COâ‚‚_release_events, final_moisture_pct, aroma_score, user_rating, and notes.
    If a file already exists and overwrite is False, the file is left unchanged.
    Set overwrite=True to replace any existing files (this will reset any existing log entries).
    Logs messages for each created file, any skipped creations (with existing entry counts if applicable), and any errors encountered.
