    """
    Generate or update companion planting and rotation guidance profile files for a given plant.

    This function scaffolds two JSON files (`companion_plants.json` and `rotation_guidance.json`)
    in the `plants/<plant_id>/` directory. It populates these files with predefined keys related
    to the plant's companion planting relationships (mutualists, antagonists, spatial notes, etc.)
    and crop rotation guidance (rotation families, soil impact, etc.), with all values defaulting
    to null (JSON null, represented as None in Python).

    If a file already exists and `overwrite` is False, the file is left unchanged.
    If `overwrite` is True or the file is missing, a new file is created (or an existing file is overwritten) with the default structure.

    All actions (creation, skipping, overwriting) are logged for clarity.

    :param plant_id: Identifier for the plant (used as directory name under the base path).
    :param base_path: Optional base directory path for plant profiles (defaults to "plants/" in the current working directory).
    :param overwrite: If True, overwrite existing files; if False, skip writing if files already exist.
    :return: The plant_id if profiles were successfully generated (or already present without changes),
             or an empty string on error (e.g., if directory creation fails).
