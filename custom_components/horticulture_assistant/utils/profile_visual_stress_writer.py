    """Create visual inspection and stress response log files for a given plant's profile directory.
    
    This scaffolds a directory under the base_path (defaults to "plants") named after the plant_id,
    and creates two JSON files within it: "visual_inspection_log.json" and "stress_response_log.json".
    The visual_inspection_log.json file is initialized as an empty list intended to hold visual inspection entries.
    Each visual inspection entry is a dictionary with fields such as "timestamp", "inspector_name", "observation_area"
    (e.g., "canopy", "root zone", "media surface"), "health_status" (visual assessment), "anomalies_detected",
    "photographic_reference" (URL or path), and "notes". The stress_response_log.json file is initialized as an 
    empty list intended to hold stress response entries. Each stress response entry includes fields like "timestamp",
    "stressor_type" (e.g., "light", "heat", "cold", "pest", "nutrient"), "affected_parts", "visible_symptoms",
    "severity_score" (1â€“5 scale), "recovery_observed", and "notes".
    
    If a file already exists and overwrite is False, the file is left unchanged.
    Set overwrite=True to replace any existing files with the default (empty list) structure.
    Logs messages for each created file, any skipped creations (with entry count if available), and any overwrite or error events.
